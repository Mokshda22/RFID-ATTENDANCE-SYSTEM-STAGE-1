Hey Viewers!
This is our first stage of our RFID Attendance System Project.
We have used the NodeMCU microcontroller, RFID Module and connected our system to Google sheets. When a RFID card will be scanned, the attendance of the student will be real time updated in the Google Sheet along with date and time.
